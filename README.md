# Scoutify AI

Multi-Agent Ethical Hiring Engine

Scoutify AI is an intelligent hiring system that screens resumes, ranks candidates, detects bias, and explains every decision.  
It turns traditional black-box recruitment into transparent, merit-based hiring.

Built by Team Zygo in a 24-hour hackathon.
